* Things of interest (in order of decreasing interest)
| Package                     | Rationale                                    |
|-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| =app-emacs/portage=         | Homemade, not present in main tree           |
| =app-emacs/ebuild-tools=    | Homemade, not present in main tree           |
| =app-emacs/elpa-to-ebuilds= | Homemade, not present in main tree           |
| =app-emacs/transient-mount= | Homemade, not present in main tree           |
| =app-emacs/console-colors=  | Homemade, not present in main tree           |
| =dev-lisp/sbcl=             | Bootstrappable with a user-specified Lisp    |
| =sys-libs/uclibc-ng=        | Allows building =openbsd-netcat=             |
| =app-emacs/imdb=            | Not present in main tree                     |
| =www-client/w3m=            | Will provide images on some X-less devices   |
| =app-emacs/vterm=           | USE =system-libvterm=; native =emacs-module= |

=dev-lisp/sbcl= also allows omitting html doc thus avoiding dependency on =graphviz=.

The rest are largely dependencies for things of interest.

* Installation
To add this to your Gentoo system:
#+begin_src sh :tangle no :results none
sudo layman -o  https://gitlab.com/akater/ebuilds/-/raw/master/repositories.xml -f -a akater
#+end_src

To remove this repository:
#+begin_src sh :tangle no :results none
sudo layman -d akater
#+end_src

If you don't have =layman=,
#+begin_src sh :tangle no :results none
sudo emerge layman
#+end_src

* Notes
This ebuild repository may contain:
- some older ebuilds dropped from mainline gentoo repository but interesting to the author
- ebuilds providing compatibility with environments interesting to the author
- experimental stuff (but most ebuilds should work)

Environments interesting to the author are mostly lightweight environments, i.e.:
- text-only environments (no X)
- non-glibc environments (uClibc, at this point)

I'm interested in 
- www-client/palemoon support for hardened Gentoo
- net-print/lprng ebuilds and filters
- all versions of app-crypt/gnupg
- bringing (at least some) packages from quicklisp and melpa into portage
