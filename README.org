* Installation
To add this to your Gentoo system:
#+begin_src sh :tangle no :results none
sudo layman -o  https://gitlab.com/akater/ebuilds/-/raw/master/repositories.xml -f -a akater
#+end_src

To remove this repository:
#+begin_src sh :tangle no :results none
sudo layman -d akater
#+end_src

If you don't have =layman=,
#+begin_src sh :tangle no :results none
sudo emerge layman
#+end_src

* Notes
This ebuild repository may contain:
- some older ebuilds dropped from mainline gentoo repository but interesting to the author
- ebuilds providing compatibility with environments interesting to the author
- experimental stuff (but most ebuilds should work)

Environments interesting to the author are mostly lightweight environments, i.e.:
- text-only environments (no X)
- non-glibc environments (uClibc, at this point)

I'm interested in 
- www-client/palemoon support for hardened Gentoo
- net-print/lprng ebuilds and filters
- all versions of app-crypt/gnupg
- bringing (at least some) packages from quicklisp and melpa into portage
